	install_tool - CUJS tool installer

SYNOPSIS
	cscript install_tool.wsf FILENAME PATH
	wscript install_tool.wsf FILENAME PATH

DESCRIPTION
	This is not mandatory action. You can use all these tools "as is". 
	You do not need run this untility. Download archive and place it's 
	content to the appropriate directory.

	This utility allows you to install CUJS tools to the comfortable 
	location. It makes two things:
	-- embeds JS scripts from the "js" directory into the tool
	-- copies a resulting file to the directory specified in the 
	argument.

	Reasonable question arises: 
	"Why I should make install if it works fine without this?"

	This was made to provide easy way to make each tool independent of 
	many files. Once downlanded and installed into the single file the 
	tool can be used without emergency of lost some parts of tool.

ARGUMENTS
	FILENAME	- the name of file that to be copied
	TARGET		- the path where the tool should be installed
